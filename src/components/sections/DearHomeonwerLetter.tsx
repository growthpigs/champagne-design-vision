              Dear Fellow Ottawa Homeowner,
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-primary mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              The $3,000 Dekton slab cracked during installation at the Ottawa Art Gallery restoration project.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-primary mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              My apprentice's face went white. "I barely touched it," he whispered.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-primary mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              That moment changed everything about how we approach premium surface installation.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-primary mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              You see, most contractors treat Dekton, Laminam, and natural stone like they're installing standard tile. They rush. They guess. They hope for the best.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-primary mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              But premium materials demand precision. Patience. Understanding.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-primary mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Each slab whispers its installation secrets to trained hands. The grain tells you where to cut. The temperature reveals when to install. The substrate speaks of preparation needs.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-primary mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              After 15 years and 34+ industry awards, I've learned that true craftsmanship isn't about speedâ€”it's about respect for materials that cost more than most people's cars.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-primary mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              That's why we limit ourselves to 8 installations monthly. Your Ottawa home deserves nothing less than museum-grade precision.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-primary mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              To bringing your vision to reality,
